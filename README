ConfrontaPDF
============

ConfrontaPDF compares two PDF files via GUI or command line.

ConfrontaPDF is based on DiffPDF. The open source DiffPDF was created and maintained by Mark
Summerfield 2008-2013. This is a fork of that project by Luca Bellonda, begun in 2015.

The source for the last release of Mark's open source version is available from:
http://www.qtrac.eu/diffpdf-foss.html. Mark's commercial versions are available from:
http://www.qtrac.eu/diffpdf.html

Command line:
ComparaPDF can compare two PDF files, writing the result to standard output,
an XML file and generate a PDF document with the differences between the
input documents. It is scriptable, and do not open windows or wait for
user input during the batch operation making it suitable for automated tests.
ComparaPDFc is a version of ComparaPDF that always runs in command line mode.

GUI:
By default the comparison is of the words on each pair of pages, but
comparing character by character is also supported (e.g., for
logographic languages). And there's also support for comparing the pages
by appearance (for example, if a diagram is changed or if a paragraph is
reformatted, or a font changed). It is also possible to compare
particular pages or page ranges. For example, if there are two versions
of a PDF file, one with pages 1-12 and the other with pages 1-13 because
of an extra page having been added as page 4, they can be compared by
specifying two page ranges, 1-12 for the first and 1-3, 5-13 for the
second. This will make ConfrontaPDF compare pages in the pairs (1, 1), (2,
2), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6), and so on, to (12, 13).

A couple of example PDF files are provided online so that you can try it
out. PDF files can be loaded from the GUI (by pressing the File #1 and
File #2 buttons), or by specifying them on the command line. More
information is available in the program's tooltips and About box.


Windows Users
=============
Use ComparaPDFc for command line only operations.

Compiling and Installing ConfrontaPDF (Mac-specific notes are at the end.)
=====================================

Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler
- Qt 4 or Qt 5 libraries
- the Poppler libraries (at least 0.20.1)

Qt4 requires the Poppler's Qt 4 headers.
Qt5 requires the Poppler's Qt 5 headers.

Linux and BSD users should be able to get compiling from sources.
Mac OS X users can get a compiler by installing Xcode; you'll need to
get Qt and Poppler separately.


Download the sources from site: git clone https://github.com/lbellonda/ConfrontaPDF
or download a zip.
2. Change directory to ComparaPDF
    $ cd ComparaPDF
3. Run lrelease;
    $ lrelease comparapdf.pro
4. Run qmake on comparapdf;
    $ qmake comparapdf.pro
5. Run make
    $ make
6. Run qmake on comparapdfc
    $ qmake comparapdfc.pro
7. Run make
    $ make
6. Copy or soft-link the comparapdf and comparapdfc executable to somewhere on your PATH
7. Only the executable is needed; all the files that were unpacked or
   generated can be safely deleted.
Windows users can find an installer script to customize in the install folder.

Building on Mac OS X
====================

Here's how to build it:

$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"
$ brew install qt
$ brew install poppler --with-qt4

# Dirs must be writeable because macdeployqt modifies copied files
$ chmod -R u+w /usr/local/Cellar/qt/
$ chmod -R u+w /usr/local/Cellar/poppler/

follow the compile steps described above up to the lrelease phase
$ qmake -spec macx-g++
$ make
